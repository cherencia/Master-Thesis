## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

# Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
In this work, a common problem faced by firms that advertise in their own apps is investigated: When should ads be renewed?\\
The problem was translated into an allocation problem within the family of Multi Armed Bandit problems (MAB). A modified version of the widely used randomized probability matching policy for Bandit problems was proposed, and compared to more traditional test and roll-out allocation policies.\\
The counterfactual simulations that were ran showed, that the proposed policy dominates over more traditional methods in terms of selection of the optimal ad and cumulative regret. This results encourage firms to shift their advertisement placing policies from test and roll-out towards learn-and-earn policies.

# File Descriptions<a name="files"></a>
